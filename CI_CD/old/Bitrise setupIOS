## Create app https://www.bitrise.io/dashboard
 - connect with github
 - request admin permission for repo
 - in workflow tab choose "Do anything with Script step" and replace echo "Hello World" with `npm i` or other commands (npm test etc.)
 - in dev console create 3 provision profile : iStore Dev, AppStore Production, AdHoc
 - archive and upload to appStore your first App version
 - configure testFlight in iTunes Connect manually and make sure all worked fine
 - next go to workflow "Code signing & Files" copy command and get provision profiles that you created above, paste all profiles in bitrise fields (including certificate)
 - Go to workflow "Secret Env var" and add your appleId pass with key FASTLANE_PASSWORD
 - In workflow editor add last step (+ button) and find fastlane
 - In fastlane lane write name of lane from FastFile that should be execute (in this example "beta")
 - Fill working directory field $BITRISE_SOURCE_DIR/ios
 - In bitrise.yml insert something like bellow, it's configure what and when build with bitrise
```
trigger_map:
- pull_request_source_branch: "*"
  pull_request_target_branch: "*"
  workflow: debug
- push_branch: master
  workflow: master
- push_branch: "*"
  workflow: debug
```
 - That's all for bitrise console

## Let's take care of our project directory

https://docs.fastlane.tools/

 - cd your project
 - cd ios folder
 - intall fastlane `sudo gem install fastlane -NV`
 - then init `fastlane init` (enter your appleId)
 - find FastFile and edit it (create lane for execute after pushing, for example lane:beta)
```
lane :beta do
increment_build_number(
    build_number: latest_testflight_build_number + 1,
    xcodeproj: "yourproj.xcodeproj"
  )
    gym(scheme: "yourproj", workspace: 'yourworkspace.xcworkspace') # or project: 'yourproj.xcodeproj'
    pilot(skip_submission: true, skip_waiting_for_build_processing: true)
    slack(channel: "ties", message: "Successfully upload to TestFlight new version")
  end
```
 - Now push this to master branch and bitrise start building and upload to iTunes your App

## That's all =)
